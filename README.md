# 3x3 Matrix Determinant Calculator

This code implements a calculator to find the determinant of a 3x3 matrix using Sarrus' rule. The calculator continues to calculate determinants until the user chooses to exit.

### How it works:

• The program displays a 3x3 matrix with letters A through I representing the elements.

• Prompts the user to enter values ​​for each element of the matrix (A through I).

• Displays the entire matrix with the values ​​provided by the user.

• Calculates the determinant of the matrix using Sarrus' rule, which involves multiplication of the matrix elements and sum of products.

• Displays the value of the determinant.

• Prompts the user if he or she wants to calculate the determinant of another matrix. If the answer is "no", the program terminates. Otherwise, the loop restarts.
